# Token-Based Quantum Emulation Experiment

This repository contains the experiment plan and mathematical framework for exploring token-based quantum emulation. The goal is to investigate the analogy between tokens in language models and qubits in quantum systems, focusing on semantic coherence and its potential parallels to quantum entanglement.

## Overview

### Hypothesis

1. **Token-Qubit Analogy:** Tokens can represent qubits, and their states can be encoded in token embeddings.
2. **Structured Randomness for Superposition:** Superposition can be simulated using structured randomness generated by a probabilistic n-gram language model, capturing probabilistic state representation with linguistic structure.
3. **Semantic Coherence Correlation for Entanglement:** Entanglement can be indicated by a statistically significant positive correlation in semantic coherence scores between pairs of token sequences. Semantic coherence will be measured using word embeddings and cosine similarity.
4. **Conceptual Token Operations for Quantum Gates:** Basic quantum gates like Hadamard and CNOT can be conceptually represented by transformations and operations on token embeddings and token sequence relationships.

### Experiment Design

The experiment involves generating structured random word sequences, measuring their semantic coherence, analyzing correlations for potential entanglement, and conceptually simulating quantum gates like the Hadamard gate.

### Mathematical Details

- **Semantic Coherence Score Calculation:** Using word embeddings and cosine similarity to quantify the coherence of word sequences.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between coherence scores of paired sequences to investigate potential entanglement.
- **Hadamard Gate Simulation:** Conceptually transforming token embeddings to mimic the effect of a Hadamard gate, aiming to create superposition and reduce coherence.
