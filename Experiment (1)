Okay, let's re-evaluate the hypothesis and outline a Python code structure that would represent a viable experiment.  This code will be conceptual, as I cannot directly execute Python, but it will clearly demonstrate the experimental steps and logic.

**Re-evaluated Hypothesis (Key Points for Experiment):**

1.  **Tokens as Qubit Analogy:** We're treating tokens as analogous to qubits.
2.  **Structured Randomness = Superposition:** N-gram language models will generate word sequences with "structured randomness" to simulate superposition.
3.  **Semantic Coherence Correlation = Entanglement Proxy:**  We will measure semantic coherence of word sequences and look for correlations in coherence between paired sequences as a potential indicator of "entanglement."
4.  **Token Embedding Transformation = Quantum Gate (Hadamard):**  We will conceptually simulate a Hadamard gate by transforming token embeddings and observe the effect on semantic coherence.

**Conceptual Python Code for Experiment:**

**Explanation of the Code and Experiment:**

*   **Conceptual Nature:**  This code is *conceptual*. It uses placeholder functions (marked with `_concept` suffix) for n-gram model training, word embedding retrieval, and cosine similarity calculation. In a real experiment, you would replace these with actual implementations using libraries like NLTK, Gensim, and SciPy.
*   **Experiment Flow:**
    1.  **N-gram Model Training (Conceptual):**  `train_ngram_model_concept` simulates training an n-gram model on a corpus.
    2.  **Word Sequence Generation:** `generate_word_sequence_concept` uses the conceptual n-gram model to generate word sequences, representing "structured randomness."
    3.  **Semantic Coherence Calculation:**
        *   `get_word_embedding_concept` is a placeholder for retrieving word embeddings.
        *   `calculate_sequence_embedding_concept` averages word embeddings to get a sequence embedding.
        *   `cosine_similarity_concept` is a placeholder for cosine similarity calculation.
        *   `semantic_coherence_score_concept` calculates the Semantic Coherence Score for a sequence.
    4.  **Entanglement Experiment (Conceptual):** `entanglement_experiment_concept` performs the correlation analysis:
        *   Generates pairs of sequences.
        *   Calculates semantic coherence for each sequence.
        *   Conceptually calculates a correlation coefficient (placeholder).
        *   Indicates where statistical significance testing would be performed.
    5.  **Hadamard Gate Simulation (Conceptual):** `hadamard_gate_simulation_concept` simulates a Hadamard gate:
        *   Gets a sample word embedding.
        *   Applies a conceptual Hadamard transformation (adding random noise).
        *   Compares average semantic coherence of sequences generated with and without the Hadamard transformation.
*   **Experiment Execution in `if __name__ == "__main__":`:**  The `main` block calls the entanglement experiment and Hadamard simulation functions to conceptually run the experiment.
*   **Print Statements:**  The code includes `print` statements at each step to show the flow of execution and conceptual results.

**Viability and Hypothesis Testing:**

*   **Entanglement Experiment:** The `entanglement_experiment_concept` directly addresses the "entanglement" hypothesis by testing if there is a correlation in semantic coherence between paired sequences.  A statistically significant positive correlation *could* be interpreted as weak evidence supporting the analogy, but with strong caveats.
*   **Hadamard Gate Simulation:** `hadamard_gate_simulation_concept` attempts to test the "quantum gate" hypothesis by showing if a conceptual Hadamard transformation (token embedding manipulation) can alter the semantic coherence of generated sequences in a way consistent with superposition creation (i.e., reduced coherence).

**Important Caveats and Next Steps (for real implementation):**

*   **Real Implementation Needed:** This code is purely conceptual. To run a real experiment, you would need to replace the `_concept` functions with actual code using NLP libraries.
*   **Refine "Entanglement" Metric:**  Pearson correlation of semantic coherence is a very basic starting point.  More sophisticated information-theoretic measures might be needed to better capture potential entanglement analogies.
*   **Hadamard Gate Transformation:** The Hadamard simulation is extremely simplified.  More sophisticated and theoretically grounded transformations of token embeddings would need to be explored.
*   **Statistical Rigor:**  In a real experiment, rigorous statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and control groups would be essential to draw any meaningful conclusions.
*   **Analogical Nature:**  It's crucial to remember that this is an *analogy*.  Even with positive results, it would not mean we have created a true quantum computer with tokens, but rather found potentially interesting parallels between language models and quantum concepts.

This conceptual code provides a more concrete representation of a viable experiment to test the core ideas of your token-based quantum emulation hypothesis. It's designed to be a starting point for further refinement and, eventually, a real implementation. Let me know what you think!
